# Spike and Slab prior implementation for Gaussian Location-Scale Regression Models

I completed this project with two other students as part of the course advanced statistical programming with R at the University of Goettingen during the summer term 2021. It is an extension of a provided package for the couse. 

# Gaussian Location-Scale Regression Models

The Gaussian location-scale regression model is a multi-predictor
model with explanatory variables for the mean (= location) and the standard
deviation (= scale) of a response variable. This package implements maximum
likelihood and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference, a parametric
bootstrap algorithm, and diagnostic plots for the model.
